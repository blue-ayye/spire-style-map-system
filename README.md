**Spire-Style Map System** is a highly customizable, procedural map generator inspired by the node-based progression of games like *Slay the Spire*. It handles everything from mathematical grid generation and pathing logic to rule-based node assignment, traversal state management, and data persistence. 

The architecture strictly separates map logic from visual representation, allowing the exact same underlying system to drive both **2D UI** (RectTransforms) and **3D World** (Transforms/LineRenderers) maps out of the box.

## 🚀 Features
- Customizable Grid: Define exact horizontal rows (levels) and nodes per level.
- Organic Layouts: Apply dynamic X/Y spatial "jitter" so the map feels hand-drawn rather than rigidly mathematical.
- Intelligent Pathing: Guarantees a minimum number of unique starting paths and prevents overlapping/crossing over other paths.
- Procedural Rule Engine: Use `ScriptableObjects` to define probabilistic weights for node types (Combats, Shops, Bosses) while enforcing sibling constraints (no identical forks) and consecutive reductions (preventing 3 shops in a row).
- Traversal Management: Tracks player movement, restricts invalid moves, and natively supports saving/loading local progress via JSON.
- UI & 3D Support: Implements `IMapNodeView` and `IMapPathView` interfaces so you can skin the logic however your game requires.

## 📦 Dependencies
This project relies on two free, highly performant plugins:
1. PrimeTween: Used heavily for optimized, zero-allocation animations (node spawning and path reveals).
2. SerializedCollections (AYellowpaper): Used to expose standard C# `Dictionaries` in the Unity Inspector for configuring Node Type rules and weights.

## 🧠 How It Works (Step-by-Step)
The generation of a map follows a strict, logical pipeline orchestrated by the MapSystemManager.

### 1. Mathematical Grid Generation (`MapNodeGenerator`)
First, the system determines the boundaries of the map container. It then generates a raw 2D array of generic MapNode objects based on your configured _maxLevels and `_nodesPerLevel`. During this phase, mathematical "jitter" is applied to each node's position to slightly offset it from a perfect grid, creating an organic look. A guaranteed Initial Node (bottom) and Final Node (boss/top) are also instantiated.

### 2. Path Generation & Connection (`MapPathGenerator`)
With the points laid out, the path generator takes over:
- Starting Nodes: It randomly selects guaranteed unique starting points for the bottom level, then fulfills the remaining quota of `_totalPaths`.
- Traversing Upward: It evaluates valid children on the next level up. To prevent visual mess, it enforces a CanOverlapPath rule—paths are not allowed to cross each other (e.g., node 1 going to node 3 while node 2 goes to node 0).
- Culling: Any node that wasn't connected to a path is destroyed and removed from the grid.

### 3. Procedural Rule Assignment (`MapNodeTypeAssigner`)
Nodes are assigned their gameplay identities (e.g., Shop, Elite, Rest) based on a list of NodeTypeRulesSO:
- Exclusivity: Rules can be set to ignore constraints (useful for forcing a Treasure node on exactly level 5).
- Consecutive Constraints: The system dynamically lowers the probability weight of a node type if the parent or child node shares that type (e.g., lowering the chance of getting back-to-back Elites).
- Sibling Constraints: Checks horizontal forks to optionally prevent a player from being presented with the illusion of choice (e.g., a path splitting into two identical Shop nodes).

### 4. Validation & Fallback
If custom seeds are disabled, the system attempts to generate the map multiple times (`_generationAttempts`). It checks for any procedural rule violations (like inescapable consecutive constraints). If it fails to find a perfect map, it falls back to the seed that had the fewest violations.

### 5. Visual Instantiation & Animation
Once the data graph is perfectly valid, the system iterates through the generic map data and spawns the physical prefabs (`IMapNodeView` and `IMapPathView`). It chains these spawns using PrimeTween to create a satisfying, cascading map reveal animation.

### 6. Traversal & State Management (`MapTraversalController`)
When a player clicks a node, the controller validates the move:
- Is it a direct child of the current node?
- Is `_canTraverseVisitedNodes` enabled, and are they clicking backward? If valid, the system updates the NodeState (`Locked`, `Reachable`, `Current`, `Visited`) which automatically updates the visual colors and icons of the node prefabs.

## 🛠️ Core Components Breakdown
| Script | Responsibility |
| ------ | -------------- |
| `MapSystemManager` | The central hub. Calls generation, tracks seeds, triggers animations, and handles Save/Load operations. |
| `MapNodeGenerator` | Handles grid bounds, dimensions, physical spacing, organic jitter, and populates the raw data array. |
| `MapPathGenerator` | Generates logical graph edges (connections) between nodes and prevents paths from crossing. |
| `MapNodeTypeAssigner` | Ingests NodeTypeRulesSO to probabilistically assign identities (Combat, Event, Shop) while enforcing constraints. |
| `MapTraversalController` | Validates player input, updates node states, and animates the player's path traversal. |
| `MapDataHandler` | Serializes the seed and traversal history to JSON, saving it to Application.persistentDataPath. |
